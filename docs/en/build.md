# 04 - Building Tunix
Building Tunix from the cloned repository can be tedious but offers additional configuration possibilities (see Section 04.2 - Build Options).

**Disclaimer:** The build process as described here only works on UNIX-Based systems. Windows and Apple Users will have to find alternatives.
## 04.1 - Prerequisites
First you will need a Cross Compiler, since TUNIX is written for the i686-Architecture. For this, you will need to build GCC and binutils from scratch.
